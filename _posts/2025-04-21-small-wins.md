It won't seem like much to anyone else, but I'm feeling a bit smug this afternoon.

For a little while, I've been frustrated with the readbility of my terminal. Directory names were appearing in dark blue. Not great on a black background. Sometimes I was having to peer at the screen a little harder than is comfortable.

I tried changing the terminal colour scheme preferences, but I really only wanted to alter this one thing.

A bit of digging on the interwebs revealed that terminal colors are determined by the `LS_COLORS` settings which live in a file called `.dircolors`. A few moments with the nano text editor, and my dark blue was replaced with a fetching cyan. Much easier to read!

As I say. Small wins.
