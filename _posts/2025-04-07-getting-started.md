### Getting started
I found the laptop I want to use for this project, an Asus Zenbook UX305 which I've had for almost 10 years. My attempt to boot a Debian distribution from USB met with failure, so I've decided to stick with the Linux Lite I had already installed. I know, it's got a GUI, but I'm going to use it it entirely from the Terminal. Honest.
