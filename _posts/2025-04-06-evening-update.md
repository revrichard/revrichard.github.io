### Jekyll works - sort of

I've got the site up, and I can create a post. Hurrah!  
But I don't seem to be able to change the theme, or apply any customization. So far, trying either of those things just results in the site breaking.

Rome wasn't built in a day though. I'm sure I'll work it out eventually.
