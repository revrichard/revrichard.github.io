### One thing leads to another
I've been getting to grips with Vim, the text editor. Whether that's a good idea or not , we'll have to see. I tried to get used to Emacs a while back, but I couldn't get on with it. Perhaps vim will be different.
This leads me to wonder about the mysteries of touch typing. I've always felt it would be beyond me, but maybe now is the time to give it a go.

Vim is certainly a complex beast, but it hasn't been as difficult to get in to as I thought it might be. It requires a very different method of working from a "normal" GUI, but I'm enjoying trying a new way of working and thinking.
