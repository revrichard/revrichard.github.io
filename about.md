# About me

I’m a Methodist Minister, serving as Superintendent Minister of the
Shropshire and Marches Methodist Circuit in the UK. Before ministry I
was part of the Worker Co-operative movement. [The Rochdale
Pioneers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rochdale_Society_of_Equitable_Pioneers) are still heroes.

I hesitate to call myself a photographer, but I do enjoy pointing a camera at things. Mostly my photography is done on film, though I’m learning to appreciate a digital picture again.

Ideologically, I suppose you could call me a lefty. I wouldn’t argue.
